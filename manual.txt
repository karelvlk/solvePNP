How to use solvePNP function

Input
    in that order:
        'x' = array of 3 or more points with XYZ coords (more points give you more accurate solution, but it's slower)
        'u' = array of point that show 'x' points on photo
        'size' = array of two numbers [width, height]
        'f' = focal length of camera
        's' = array of size of CCD sensor of camera [width, height]
        'i' = number of iterations (used in cases of >=5 points, default (None) is 10 that is also minimum of iterations)

Output:
    Without problems:
        'point': [] = camera position XYZ
        'ypr': [] = yaw, pitch, roll of the camera ( 0deg North, + left direction, - right direction )
        'points_inaccuracy': [] = array of objects for each point
                            in each object  {
                                                dl: (direction - Pythagorean theorem from dx and dy),
                                                dx: (direction on x axis),
                                                dy: (direction on y axis)

                                            }
                            (In case of 3 or 4 points, first 3 points have always inaccuracy 0, because of solving method)
        'global_inaccuracy': all points inaccuracy summed up
        'details': { 'result_list }

    With some problems:
        'errors': [] = in the array there are strings that announce mistakes
